# CodeAlpha_Tasks
This Repository includes two CyberSecurity projects for CodeAlpha Basic Network Sniffer and Phishing Awareness Training.

## Task 1: Network Packet Sniffer

This Network Sniffer captures and analyzes live network packets with extra functionality like suspicious packet detection and GeoIP metadata lookup.

###  Features
- Live network traffic capture using `scapy`
- User-selectable payload view modes:
  - `short`, `full`, `hex`, `ascii`
- GeoIP metadata:
  - Country, ISP, organization, VPN/proxy status
- Colored terminal output for readability
- Logging:
  - All packets → `all_sniffed_packets.csv`
  - Suspicious packets → `suspicious_packets.txt`
- Suspicious activity detection (DoS-like behavior)

### 📁 Files
- `packet_sniffer.py` – main script
- `all_sniffed_packets.csv` – log of all captured packets
- `suspicious_packets.txt` – log of suspicious packets with payload

# Requirements

```bash
pip install scapy termcolor requests```


#Note: Run with sudo for full packet sniffing access.

⸻

#▶ How to Run

sudo python3 packet_sniffer.py

	•	Educates users about phishing and its types
	•	Shares detection techniques
	•	Provides safety best practices
	•	Includes real-world examples
